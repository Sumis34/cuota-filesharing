## The Story of Cuota

Hello, I'm Noé and I'm a hobbiest web developer and passionate Filmmaker. [Cuota](https://cuota.noekrebs.ch) is a project that started around 2 years ago.

When i just started learning web development, I wanted a website where I could share my work with my clients. The problem was that sites like [WeTransfer](https://wetransfer.com/) have a very limited amount of file size to transfer in their free tier.

Thats why I decided to create a website of my own. It started out with a **PHP Project** that I later abandoned because it was not reliable at all. More then a year later I started a second attempt with [Cuota](https://cuota.noekrebs.ch). **This time it worked out!**

## Benefits of Cuota

As a Filmmaker, I wanted to have a place to share my work with my clients but not many offer the convenience and ease of use of [Cuota](https://cuota.noekrebs.ch). One of its gratest features is that it offers advanced but simple file sharing / and Online preview. So there is no need for your client to download all the Images/videos he can just choose his favorit and download it **in one click**.  

- Grate preview features optimized for creators
- It's a free website
- Open Source on [Github](https://github.com/Sumis34/cuota-filesharing)
